=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $col = Grinder::KmerCollection->new( -k    => 10,
                                          -file => 'seqs.fa' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

                     (default: 0)
           -seqs     count kmers in the provided arrayref of sequences (Bio::Seq
                     or Bio::SeqFeature objects)
           -ids      if specified, index the sequences provided to -seq using the
                     use the IDs in this arrayref instead of using the sequences
                     $seq->id() method
           -file     count kmers in the provided file of sequences
           -weights  if specified, assign the abundance of each sequence from the
                     values in this arrayref
